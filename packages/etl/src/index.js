 * Extract, Transform, Load pipeline for the GroundedOS Lab monorepo.
 *
 * Public API
 * ----------
 * - `ingest(input)`       — unified entry point; routes to the correct extractor
 * - `TextExtractor`       — working plain-text extractor
 * - `PdfExtractor`        — implemented (full PDF text extraction)
 * - `ImageExtractor`      — stub (Phase 1)
 * - `AudioExtractor`      — stub (Phase 1)
 *
 * Core types are re-exported here for convenience so consumers do not need a
 * direct dependency on `@groundedos/core` for the most common types.
